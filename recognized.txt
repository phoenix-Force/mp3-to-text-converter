August 15 chapter of fire and explosion and exclusion and this particular module we are going to discuss their problems they are related to the related to the fire and explosion aspect so before we start that let us have a look about that what we have studied in that what we have studied in last module we had a discussion about the fire and explosion then we had brought this discussion about what does a discussion about the fire triangle then flammability characteristics 882 lfl and UEFA we had classified with the definition about the explosion frozen had a discussion about the vapour cloud explosion then we discussed about the believe we ended WB and dust explosion we had a broad spectrum of various uses of fire strength testing fire accident testing usual apart from the classification of those fire extinguishers and also we have a discussion about we have a discussion about the different classes of fire in this particular module we are going to discuss discuss physical problems especially numerical problems related to the fire and explosion show latest so let us have a look about the first problem and this problem is related to the left lower lfl lower flammability limit and upper flammability limit of a gas mixture which is composed of. It WhatsApp. 8% of hexene 2% of Methane and. 5% of Ethylene by volume ethylene by volume so is the mixture which is having three different hydrocarbons and all all hydrocarbons are having the the flammability aspect so let's have a discuss about this particular problem about this particular problem to handle this type this problem we need certain statistical information or statistical information of certain distance information which we discuss in due course of time so the first English the first thing which we need to calculate is the mole fraction on combustible basis that is places that is that fuel only basis and we have to construct a table so that we can put all the leaders put all the the desired values in that particular table so that have a look about the solution of this ocean of this particular problem which is comprises of three different hydrocarbons so we so list those hydrocarbons like hexane which is given in the problem so hexane is having. 8% volume then we will have to calculate the mole fraction fraction on combustible basis then we will have a LFL continue FL that is again based on volume percent so we are having exam then we are then we are having the methane YouTube percent then we are having ethylene 0.5% show the total combustible they are coming out to be 3.3 so show the remaining part we are having that is 96.7 so if we can if we calculate the mole fraction on combustible basis it is coming out to be 0.24 24 lfl on the basis of a volume percent is given as upon you can have this particular information particulars information from your text book that is scout and we have supplied the the standard table at the end of this particular module this is 1.2 and usl is 7.5 these are the standard and Android me for Methane the elephant is 5.3 and useful is 15 and ethylene ethylene it is 3.1 and ufl is 32. 2.0 so we have calculated with respect to the mole fraction and then then we are going ahead with the standard formula which we had discussed in the Fire the feelings doesn't think so that we may use this equation that is it lfl lfl mixture is equal to one upon submission is equal to 12 and and number 212 n and number of components component and lfl of individual component so if we calculate it is come it it is come coming out to be one upon 0.24 which we have discussed over here divided divided by 1.2 that is alpha of individual then we calculate the Methane which is bed Methane which is the having a mole fraction of 4.61 and lfl is 5.3 free and the NFL is 3.1 which is 363 1:45. 75% by by volume combustible Fol 9 letters have a look about the USA of this particular mixture mixture and the Fury call that the formula is almost similar so whether ufl of the mixture is 1 upon phone mole fraction and then ufl of an individual component so one upon 0.24 which period early described and 7.5 + zero point + 0.61 upon 15 the useful of the component + 0.15 0.15 9% by project total despotico mixture contains 3.3 % of total mixture contains and we have calculated that lfl and ufl FL Android ufl is 12.9 and level is 5.3 so it is it'll it is the flammable because it falls under the the range of and USA soda mixture is flammable so this is the the solution with which you can easily calculate easily calculate that whether a particular mixture is combustible or not aur not and we had three different hydrocarbon signal in Methane early Nakshatra Helen at 17 so I can calculate that and if it is falls under the under the elephant and ufl range then you need to take 7 precautions 9 letters have a look about the 9 letters have a look about the II problem the ufl for a substance is 13.0 percent by volume at 0 Mega pass zero Mega Paas kal yes pressure then you need to calculate the ufl at 6.8 mega pascal it mega pascal key is not remember that our previous modulus if we have dinner we have derive the formula which is showing the impact of a pressure change to the elephant and UEFA elephant and you FL absolute pressure aap absolute pressure is given by P is equal to 6.8 + 0.1 0.101 and cheese comes out to be no you can determine the US well at a given pressure by this particular equation the standard ufl standard ufl and 20.6 log P + 1 so this is 30 13 which we have calculated from the table which is present this is this is there in the last light of this particular module + 20.6 lock 6.90 oneplus one so it is coming out to be the 50.8 50.8 so this is the answer of this particular problem problem so now let us have a look about the next problem which is the problem number problem number 3 the lfl and you need to estimate the lower flammability limit that is LT limit that is lfl and upper flammability limit for hexane and you need to compare the calculator compare the calculated limit to the actual values are determined experimentally so in this particular so in this particular problem we need to 26 the help of the psychometric formula which we had disc which we had discussed in the theoretical models so let's have a look about the about the solution of this particular problem latest discuss about the structure Maitri of this particular reaction this is C6 h12 Z O2 + sorry MC O2 + 2 H2O show Z m MX they are found the chemical reaction so by balance by balancing we can find that m is equal to 6 and x is equal to 14 which is 3 which is given by the formula so lfl and useful they are determined by Alpha is equal to is equal to 0.5 V remember that particular from love this we have already discussed in the theoretical module the theoretical module and this is 4.76 M + 1.19 x x minus 2.38 y + 1 and similarly the UEFA Liz 3.50 upon 4.76 employee 76 + 1.19 x minus 2.38 y plus wife plus one so these are the lfl and useful formulas formula latest calculate the lfl and useful for the that's the problem and it is the letters have a look about the NFL it is 0.2 and lfl educated 0.55 in 200 divided by 4.76 into 6 + 1. 1.19 into 14 + 1 and this is coming to be 1.19 on the basis of volume percent is equal to 1.2 21.2 actual basis 3.5 into 100 / 4.76 into 6 + 1.19 + 1.19 into 14 + 1 this is 7.5 volume percent on actual basis basis Ada standard lfl and ufl for this component in question and you can have it from the from the last slide and you can come there that theoretically whatever you find it you find it out and what is the difference between the theoretical value and the experimental value experimental value and sometimes this particular things are extremely important the reason is that because of the slide because of the slide aviation the properties of the component with respect to elephant and useful method change the limiting are minimum oxygen concentration so here you need to calculate the limiting oxygen concentration LOC for the Newton that is C4 what is C4 h10 so let us have a look about the this problem for this particular problem we need particular problem we need to have the security question a Priority best accumetric of this particular equation suggest that C4 h10 + 6 + 6.5 O2 this is the basic combustion equation for SEO 2 + 5 + 5 H2O soe if we see the elephant of a beauty lesson of a butane from our table it is comes out to be 1.9% by war by volume so from Statue metric equation oxygen concentration that is the moles of fuel divided / total MOS in 2 moles of oxygen divided by moles of mulesoft it is lfl into I'm also if field is equal to 1.9 total moles of oxygen divided by 1.0 moles feel so by this the LOC is coming out to be 12.4% volume oxygen so the you can prevent the combustion of butane by written by addition of Nitrogen carbon dioxide or any inert gas or even sometimes what even sometimes water vapour made this think which is below to keep the things below 112 one 12.4% so however one thing must be noted that the water the water addition is not recommended because the any condition that condenses the water the water would move the oxygen concentration back into the flammable reason so this this this may be the this this maybe the critical issue so you need to have an appropriate inert inert gas or inert material to be inserted in that particular chamber 9 letters have a look about the problem number 5 not this problem is that what will be the final temperature final temperature after compressing air over liquid hexane from one atmosphere 234 atmosphere mysterious the initial temperature of the hexagon is given to you that is 37.2 37.7 degrees celsius and this is very common industrial problem remember when we are compressing this then we cannot overlook the importance of importance of other thermodynamic property that is auto ignition temperature the auto ignition temperature of hexane is is 47 degree Celsius and gamma for air is given as 1 as 1.42 latest solve this particular problem so we are having the thermodynamic equation thermodynamic equation that is 30 ft is equal to initial temperature this is a final temperature so final pressure final pressure divided by the initial pressure and gamma minus one upon Gamma know this now this for this dirty final is 487 which is given the problem plus two the problem + 273 34110. 4.1.4 so that PF is coming out to be 20 coming out to be 2081 say that 2082 Kelvin which is equal to 1808 degree Celsius so this is the answer not this temperature because the auto ignition temperature the auto ignition temperature is 487 so this exceeds the it so you need and main cause because so you need to take the precautionary this gift that admin I can say that this one is the theoretical him and a basic basic thermodynamics problem problem is big big lubricating oil in Piston type compressor is all compressor is always found in minute amounts in the cylinder bore and the compression operation must always be must always be maintained well below the auto ignition temperature of the oil to prevent any kind of explosion that might occur explain that might occur in due course of time because of the involvement of the process so we are having a particular lubricating oil article lubricating oil which is having and auto ignition temperature of 400 degree Celsius the here we need to compute the we need to compute the compression ratio required to raise the temperature of air to the auto ignition temp auto ignition temperature of this particular oil we need to take an assumption that an initial air temperature temperature of is 25 degree Celsius and 1 atmosphere so that show the 25 degree Celsius is a very common temperature aspect solartis have a solution of this particular problem now here here again go back to the fundamental thermodynamic equation that is that EF is equal to call to P final upon gama - 1 upon Gama for competition sorry for the compression ratio we have PF upon which is equal to 3 f upon 2tf upon t i your having all the values ready made with us so 25 because we have assume this the 25 degree Celsius 273 Ramapuram, -1 is coming out to be 17.3 so this ratio this ratio 17.3 17.3 atmosphere so the actual the actual compression ratio ratio of the pressure should be kept well below to this particular value so it is desired it is desired that it should be kept well below value the the thermodynamic aspect 9 letters have a look about the next problem no this problem not this problem is rated the involvement of trinitrotoluene so one kilogram of 1 kilogram of trinitrotoluene is exploded so you need to compute the overpressure at a distance of at a distance of 30 M from the explosion perfect colour problem we need to have a graph which represents the scaled overpressure scaled overpressure and the skilled distance and this is a log graph and and this graphs descriptive paragraph or a plot is available in various handbooks various hand books 200 represent for the design calculation of the fire and explosion so it is easy so it is easily available graph so we need to calculate the scaling parameter which we can which we can determine with the use of this particular equation to Z is equal to R is equal to or upon is equal to 30 metre because 30 is given to your problem 1 kilogram of TNT which is coming out to be 30 now if we go back to this particular plot so by this way we can calculate we can calculate the because we have calculated the z e is equal to is equal to 30 M the skilled overpressure so it is because this is a standard one so it is it is somewhere where is lying so from this particular figure we can calculate the scaled killed
